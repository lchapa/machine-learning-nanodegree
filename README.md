# machine-learning-nanodegree
Repo created for submitting projects to Udacity in order to pass the Machine Learning Nanodegree

* **titanic_survival_exploration** .- First project 0. This project is about the list of passengers in the Titanic, 
describing them with information such as name, age, sex, race, class, and of coruse one field to say if he or she survived 
to the shipwreck, among other features. Then, the algoritm make a linear model to predict if a passenger is able to survive.
In this project I could scratch the surface of the big potential of this kind of algorithms have to give.

* **boston-housing** .- In this project, a list of houses, some of its features and the price is given in a dataset. 
The objective is to create a model that guesses the price of a house accordingly to its featrures. 

* **finding_donorsg** .- This project in reagrds of helping a non-lucrative association to find potential donors in cash. 
With this model they wanted to reduce the phone calls they have to make to find one donor. The Algorithm is addressing them
to the most likely people who like to make a donation by assesing characteristics like their income, family members, 
cost of living, amog some others. Here I could see the kind of algorithms exists, charateristics of each one them, and 
figure out the outcome of the algorithm accordingly to the requirements.

* **dog_breed** .- This project is about CNN or Convolutional Neural Networks. These networks are specialized to process high
dimensional data sets, as an image migth be. So, thet dataset is about training images of dogs and predicts the dog's breed. 
The training in this regards is so computationally expensive for a low accuracy, but, afortunately the big companies have 
trained some models on millions of day-to-day images, so that experienced networks can be used for a specific porpuses 
like the one this project is about: dog breed prediction, or the most resembling one if a human face is assesed in the 
algorithm (just for fun). As well, this folder includes a set in the model in a web app using web.py as framework.
